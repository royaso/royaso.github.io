从ipad百度云传送文件到pc

一般人的做法:ipad连pc,开itunes

我的做法:

1. ssh to ipad
2. rename the downloaded file to their real filename
3. create soft link to the files
4. using bash to scp those files to pc

why:

1. dont like to physicall reach my arm to connect ipad to pc
2. It's normal to think like that way when you are used to copying file that way
3. some excerse to deal with 'real' problem
4. 'beause I can'
5. no itunes in my pc, it's ubuntu, even though I can manage to install itunes, Its usage is beyoung my comprehens, just to copying files to pc to have a big software on my pc?! That is a waste!

how:

what you need

1. a linux OS or a ssh tool just to ssh into ipad
2. so a jailbroken ipad and open-ssh ready
3. some basic bash knowledge,to batch scp to pc,simple enough, just put all command in a file
4. a little more advanced vim skill to batch rename
5. a little linux skill, link `ln a b` ,to save some space and avoid some destruction
6. be geeky

OR you can have a boyfriend like me to do all the dirty work for you, Dont you dare treat me like "you are a good guy"!!!
